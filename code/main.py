''' Task # 2: 
Choose one of the two algorithms, SARSA and Q-learning, run it for various values of α and compare the two in terms of:
- computational efficiency, i.e., the time taken to converge;
- maximizing reward: Run the learned policies for each α value for various starting states and calculate the average reward to see 
which α value results in the most average reward
